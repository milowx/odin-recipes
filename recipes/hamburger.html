    <h2><em>Description</em></h2>

    <p>
        The best burger recipe for summertime grilling! This juicy burger is jam-packed 
        with all kinds of stuff and has no tasteless bread crumbs. Serve on buns with 
        your favorite condiments.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cooked on a grill heated to high heat, these hamburger patties should be fully cooked 
        after about 4 to 5 minutes per side. You’ll know they’re done when the juices run clear, 
        they’re no longer pink in the center, and an instant-read thermometer reads at least 165 
        degrees F.
